            <p>I am Jonathan Boulton and I like to create. My interest in software development started in 2017, my first year
                of college, when I saw an a friend coding for a project in his CS class. I knew imedeiatly it was incredibly 
                complex and I would never grasp a single concept. He then started to show me how to download a virtual machine
                and install my first linux distro. I learned basic file traversal through the terminal and usage of some tools.
                I was a well boneified script kiddie. Over time I became totally mesmorized by my career, at the time, as a chef and put the idea of any interaction
                with technology purely surface level. I was exclusively an end user. 
            </p>
            <p>
               I moved to NYC to work in michilen star fine dining. Turns out spending 12-13 hours a day sweating over a stove
               is actually really intensive work. After much thought I decided to put my head back in the ring and fully 
               focus on technology again.                 
            </p>
            <p>
                The transition was surprising. All the work is laid out ready for an aspiring software enthusist to take hold.
                I started with learning the basics of Python and creating some simple projects. Then moved to HTML, CSS, and 
                now javascript.
